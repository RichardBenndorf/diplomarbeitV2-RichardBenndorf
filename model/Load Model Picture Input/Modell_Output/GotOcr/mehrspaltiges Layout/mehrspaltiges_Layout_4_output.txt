Oxygen sensor(s)
4.1.3.1.
Oxygen sensor component(s) drawing(s)
: Annex 3.2.12.1.
4.1.3.2.
Drawing of exhaust device with oxygen
sensor location(s) (dimensions relative to
exhaust valves)
: Sensor is a "switching" or "Stoichiometric" O2 sensor that
provides an indication to the ECM as to whether the
air/fuel ratio is above or below Stoichiometric. The
sensing element generates a higher voltage in the "rich"
state and switches to a lower voltage in the "lean"
state. The switching point of our sensors is around 1.004
lambda.
4.1.3.4.
Identifying part number(s)
: Annex 3.2.12.1.
4.1.3:5.
Description of oxygen sensor heating
system and heating strategy
: The O2 sensors have a resistive heating element
embedded with the sensing element.  Power for the heater
is supplied by the System Power circuit, and PWM control
of the heater is performed by the ECM with a low side
driver.
