Oxygen sensor(s)

4.4. Sensor component(s) drawing(s) :

4.5. Drawing of exhaust device with oxygen sensor location(s) (dimensions relative to exhaust valves) :

Control range(s) :
Sensor is a "switching" or "Stoichiometric" O2 sensor that provides an indication to the ECM as to whether the airfuel ratio is above or below Stoichiometric. The sensing element generates a higher voltage in the "rich" state and switches to a lower voltage inthe "lean" state. The switching point of our sensors is around 1 .004 lambda.

4 1 3 4 . Identifying part number(s) Annex 4 32 12 4

4 45. Description of oxygen sensor heating system and heating strategy The O2 sensors have a resistive heating element embedded with the sensing element. Power for the heater is supplied by the System Power circuit, and PWM control of the heater by the ECM with a low side driver.
