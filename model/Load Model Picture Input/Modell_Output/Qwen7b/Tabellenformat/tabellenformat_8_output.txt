Sure, here is the table from the old document with the multi-columns layout displayed correctly:

| Component/System | Monitoring Strategy | Malfunction Criteria | Secondary Parameters | Fault Code |
|---|--- | --- | ---| ---|
| Exhaust air injection valve | Circuit continuity, signal range check | Lower threshold, short to ground | Upper threshold | P0412, P004F |
| Purge control valve | | Lower | Upper | P443, P459 |
| Side stand position switch (sensor) | | Signal check | Receiving of malfunction signal | P1590 |
| CAN communication | Communication check | A period of the circuit malfunction is ≥ XCA CAN | CAN line disconnection or short-circuit ≥ 4sec, Communication with a dashboard unreceivable or an unusual value ≥ 10sec, | P690, P169 |
|| | Communication with MCU is unreceivab | | |
| Immobilizer | System check | Immobiliser check after ignition on was not succesfull | P | P |
| Oil temperature sensor | Communication Check | Oil temperatur reading via CAN is malfunction | P2196 | P300 |
|| EEPROM check | Reading value and writing value in EEPROM data are different | P503 | P702, |
| CC Cancel signal | Plausibility check | Comparison APS signal 1 vs. APS signal | | P806C |
| Clutch pressure sensor | Circuit Continuity, Signal Range Check | Lower, short | Upper, short, ground | P901, P911 |
| Shift shaft sensor | | | Upper |
| Crank sensor | Lower |
