I have this old document. I need the text it contains for my work. Can you please extract the text for me, but please don't add any words. I need the text exactly as it is in the document. Pay attention to the formatting and the correct use of line breaks.assistant

The image shows a diagram of a motorcycle with various components labeled. The labels are in black text boxes with an orange arrow pointing to the corresponding part of the bike. The text boxes are arranged around the bike, with some overlapping each other.

The labels include:

* brake disk rear @ 240mm
* wheel speed sensor (WSS) rear
* rear brake calliper
* rear master cylinder @ 13mm brake fluid reservoir
* front master cylinder @ 11mm
* floating brake disc front @ 320mm
* wheel speed sensor (WSS) front
* front brake calliper
* ABS modulator Bosch 6MP
* rear brake calliper
* rear master cylinder @ 13mm brake fluid reservoir
* front master cylinder @ 11mm
* floating brake disc front @ 300mm
* wheel speed sensor (WSS) front
* front brake calliper
* ABS modulator Bosch 6MP

The background of the image is a light gray color, with a darker gray shadow behind the bike. The overall effect is one of a technical diagram, with a focus on the various components of the motorcycle and their relationships to each other.
