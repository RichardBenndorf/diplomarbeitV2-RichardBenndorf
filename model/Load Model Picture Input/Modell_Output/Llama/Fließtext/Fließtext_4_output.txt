**Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)**

* The throttle induction module is fitted with one throttle position sensors (TPS).
* The sensor is a single slope contacting potentiometer.
* The throttle position sensors provide information about throttle angle for transient fuel and spark timing.

**Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP Sensor)**

* The CKP Sensor is a magnetic pickup device mounted on the left hand primary cover near the top.
* To calculate engine speed for the ECM, the sensor picks up signals from the presence of 32 teeth machined into the left flywheel cheek.
* A gap, created by the removal of two teeth, establishes a Top Dead Center (TDC) reference.

**Engine Coolant Temperature Sensor (ECT Sensor)**

* The ECT Sensor monitors coolant temperature in the thermostat housing area between the front and rear cylinder.
* This information is used by the ECM during engine warm-up periods for the purpose of idle speed adjustment to determine inject pulse width or fueling requirements and spark advance during elevated temperatures.

**Throttle Position Sensor (TP Sensor)**

* The TP Sensor is a potentiometer mounted on the side of the Induction Module and attached to the end of the throttle shaft.
* It provides the ECM with information about throttle angle for transient fuel and spark timing.

**Oxygen Sensor (O2 Sensor)**

* Two heated O2 Sensors are used, one in each exhaust pipe located downstream of the exhaust ports.
* The O2 Sensor measures oxygen in the exhaust system.
* The ECM uses input from the O2 Sensor to keep the air fuel mixture balanced.

**OTHER FEATURES**

* Wire Harnesses - The EFI wire harness is the only wire harness on the vehicle.
* Low Level Fuel Warning Lamp - A fuel gauge and a low fuel level warning lamp have been provided.
* The lamp is activated when the fuel level reaches about 1/2 to 1 gallon and stays lit until the engine is turned off or fuel is added.
* The lamp is designed so that it will not blink when movement of the vehicle causes the fuel to slosh inside the tank.

**Fuses and Relays**

* One electrical relay is provided, which powers the fuel pump, ignition coil and injectors.
* To provide circuit protection, the appropriate fuses are supplied in a sealed fuse holder.
* Another holder at the same location contains spare fuses.

**Check Engine Lamp**

* The Check Engine Lamp on the instrument panel indicates the existence of a fault condition.

Overall, the text provides detailed information about the various sensors and components used in a vehicle's engine management system, as well as other features such as wire harnesses, low level fuel warning lamps, fuses and relays, and the check engine lamp.
