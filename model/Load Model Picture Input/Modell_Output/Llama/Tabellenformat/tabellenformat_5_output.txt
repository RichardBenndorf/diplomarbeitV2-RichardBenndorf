**Table of Minimum Geometric Visibility Angles**

| **In the event of failure of a direction indicator, the other must continue to flash or remain lit.** | **Yes / No** |
| --- | --- |
| **Visibility of red lights towards the front** | **Yes / No** |
| **Visibility of white lights towards the rear** | **Yes / No** |
| **The front lights move in line with the steering angle** | **Yes / No** |
| **Vertical inclination of the dipped beam headlamp** | **Pass / Fail** |

**Minimum geometric visibility angles**

| **Main-beam headlamp(s)** | **Vertical [°]** | **Horizontal [°]** | **Pass / Fail** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Up/Down: 5** | Left/Right: 5 | Pass / Fail |
| **Dipped-beam headlamp(s)** | **Up: 15** | **Left/Right: 45** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Down: 10** | **Outward: 45** | **Inward: 10** |  |
| **Front position lamp(s)** | **Up/Down: 15** | **Left/Right: 80** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Direction indicator lamps, Front** | **Up/Down: 15** | **Outward: 80** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Direction indicator lamps, Rear** | **Up/Down: 15** | **Outward: 80** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Rear position lamp(s)** | **Up/Down: 15** | **Left/Right: 80** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Stop lamp(s)** | **Up/Down: 15** | **Left/Right: 45** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Rear retro-reflector** | **Up/Down: 15** | **Left/Right: 30** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Side retro-reflector** | **Up: 15** | **Front/Rear: 30** | **Pass / Fail** |
| **Down: 5** |  |  | **not applicable** |

**Note:** The table has a total of 17 rows and 5 columns. The first column lists the conditions for the minimum geometric visibility angles, while the second column provides the corresponding values. The third column shows the pass/fail status for each condition. The fourth column displays the minimum geometric visibility angles in degrees for each condition. The fifth column indicates whether the condition is applicable or not.
