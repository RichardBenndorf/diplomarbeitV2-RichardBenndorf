4.1.13.1 Drawing of exhaust device with oxygen sensor location, dimensions relative to control valves
Annex 3.2.1.2

4.1.13.2 Oxygen sensor (switching or stoichiometric O2 sensor that provides indication to the ECM as to whether the air-fuel ratio is above or below stoichiometric. The sensing element generates a higher voltage in the "rich" air-fuel state and switches to a lower voltage in the "lean" air-fuel state. The switching point of our sensors is around 1.044 lambda)
