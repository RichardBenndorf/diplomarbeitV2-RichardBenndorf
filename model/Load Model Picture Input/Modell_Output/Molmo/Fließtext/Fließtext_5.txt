 Throttle body TB and fuel rail. The throttle body TB distributes fuel and air to engine cylinders. An aluminum dual runner with separate fuel rail houses fuel injectors, fuel pressure regulator, throttle position sensor, idle speed control actuator, and throttle plates/linkages. Fuel fittings connect fuel supply/return to fuel tank. Five sensors provide ECM with environmental/engine operating data influencing fuel spark requirements. A brief description of each sensor follows. Crankshaft position sensor CKP. Magnetic pickup device in left crankcase half near alternator plug calculates engine speed. TDC establishes gap for CKP sensor. Coolant temperature sensor ET. Monitors engine coolant temperature, mounted between engine V. Used for idling, warm-up, and high-speed data. Intake air temperature sensor IAT. Located in front cylinder intake, provides oxygen content data for fuel delivery during cold start/warm-up. Manifold air pressure sensor MAP. Monitors manifold air pressure, senses engine load for fuel spark timing. Throttle position sensor TP. Potentiometer on throttle body, provides throttle angle information for transient fuel and spark timing. Wire harnesses. Single main harness with separate small engine harness connected. Low fuel warning lamp. Activated at 1/2 to 1.5 gallons, stays lit until engine starts or fuel added. Fuses and relays. One electrical relay powers fuel pump, ignition coil, injectors. Starter relay supplies fused components. Air cleaner mounted in air box on top of cylinders. Check engine lamp indicates fault conditions on instrument panel. Data link connector provides on-board diagnostics for system problem determination. Scanalyzer connected to ECM for in-depth diagnosis. Diagnostics test lamp and Scanalyzer provide connection options.
