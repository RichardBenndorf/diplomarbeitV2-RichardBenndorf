| Control range(s) Sensor is a "switching" or "Stoichiometric" O2 sensor that provides an indication to the ECM as to whether the airfuel ratio is above or below Stoichiometric. The sensing element generates a higher voltage in the "rich" state and switches to a lower voltage in "lean" state. The switching point of our sensors is around 1004 lambda. |
