**Explanation:**

- The table lists various components and systems in a vehicle, along with their monitoring strategies, malfunction criteria, secondary parameters, and fault codes.
- The monitoring strategies include signal range checks, circuit continuity checks, and signal check.
- Malfunction criteria are listed for each component/system, such as short to the ground for the #1 ignition coil.
- Secondary parameters are also listed for some components, such a signal frequency for the side stand position switch.
- Fault codes are provided for each malfunction, such P0412 for the exhaust air injection valve and P0196 for the oil temperature sensor.
